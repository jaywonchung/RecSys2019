# RecSys2019 Experiments

## Introduction

These are the codes written for the experiments on the RecSys 2019 challenge **Trivago user interaction dataset**. Each ipython notebook file contains code for data preprocessing, model definition, loss definition, training, and inference.

## 1-A. Factorization Machine

A variant of the factorization machine is implemented and trained. Results are barely better than the given baseline algorithm.

## 1-B. Simple Neural Network
